## To-Do List

Here's a list of tasks for developers to complete the project:

1. **Implement Core Scanner Functionality**:
   - Develop the main scanner module (scanner.py) to orchestrate vulnerability checks.

2. **Create Reporting Module**:
   - Design and implement the reporting module (reporting.py) to generate detailed reports.

3. **Add Vulnerability Checks**:
   - Develop specific vulnerability check modules (e.g., xss.py, sql_injection.py) within the vulnerabilities/ submodule.

4. **Implement Testing Plugins**:
   - Create testing plugins (e.g., website.py, app.py) within the plugins/ submodule to scan different types of applications.

5. **Write Unit Tests**:
   - Implement unit tests in the tests/ folder to ensure the reliability of the codebase.

6. **Document the Project**:
   - Write user manual and developer guide documentation in the docs/ folder.

7. **Package the Project**:
   - Create a setup script (setup.py) for packaging the project and define dependencies in requirements.txt.

8. **Prepare for Contribution**:
   - Write contribution guidelines and license information.

9. **Test and Validate**:
   - Test the tool extensively to ensure its functionality and correctness.

10. **Release and Share**:
    - Release the tool as a PyPI package and share it with the community.

## Available Tests and Methods for Penetration Testing a Website

Penetration testing (pen testing) is a crucial process for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in a website. Below is a list of common tests and methods used for pen testing a website along with their uses:

1. **Information Gathering**:
   - *Whois Lookup*: Obtain domain registration information.
   - *DNS Enumeration*: Discover DNS records and subdomains.
   - *Web Server Identification*: Identify the web server software and version.
   - *Spidering/Crawling*: Map out the website's structure and endpoints.

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - *SSL/TLS Configuration*: Check for proper SSL/TLS configuration to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - *HTTP Headers Analysis*: Verify security-related headers (e.g., Content Security Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.).
   - *File and Directory Permissions*: Check for misconfigured file and directory permissions that may expose sensitive data.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment**:
   - *SQL Injection (SQLi)*: Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities by injecting SQL code into input fields.
   - *Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)*: Test for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious scripts into web pages.
   - *Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)*: Test for CSRF vulnerabilities by forging requests from a trusted user.
   - *Security Misconfiguration*: Identify common misconfigurations that could lead to security vulnerabilities.
   - *Sensitive Data Exposure*: Check for exposure of sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers.
   - *Authentication Bypass*: Test for weaknesses in authentication mechanisms that could allow unauthorized access.
   - *Session Management*: Assess the security of session management mechanisms and tokens.
   - *File Inclusion*: Test for file inclusion vulnerabilities (e.g., Local File Inclusion, Remote File Inclusion).
   - *Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)*: Test for SSRF vulnerabilities by tricking the server into making unauthorized requests.
   - *XML External Entity (XXE)*: Test for XXE vulnerabilities by exploiting XML parsing functionality.

4. **Client-Side Testing**:
   - *Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass*: Test for bypasses in CSP rules that could allow execution of malicious scripts.
   - *Client-Side Injection*: Test for injection vulnerabilities in client-side technologies like JavaScript.
   - *Browser Security*: Assess browser security settings and potential vulnerabilities.
   - *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)*: Test for misconfigurations in CORS policies that could lead to data exposure.

5. **Access Control Testing**:
   - *Authorization Bypass*: Test for weaknesses in authorization mechanisms that could allow unauthorized access to restricted resources.
   - *Privilege Escalation*: Test for ways to elevate privileges beyond what is intended.

6. **Business Logic Testing**:
   - *Logic Flaws*: Test for logical flaws in the application's workflow that could lead to unauthorized actions or data exposure.

7. **API Testing**:
   - *API Security*: Test for security vulnerabilities in APIs, including authentication, authorization, and data exposure.

8. **Reporting**:
   - *Report Generation*: Compile findings into a comprehensive report detailing discovered vulnerabilities, their severity, and recommendations for mitigation.

These tests and methods are essential for identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in web applications, helping to secure them against potential attacks and breaches.
